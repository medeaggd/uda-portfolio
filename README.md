##Megan Quinn's Udacity Portfolio
This is a personal portfolio designed to show off projects completed for the Udacity Front-End nanodegree course, along with work done for the Grow With Google challenge. This file and links therein are a glimpse of my developing skills as a front-end web dev (and my woeful neglect of digital art skills).

##Viewing
This is intended as a webpage to be viewed on a range of devices, ideally between 350px-900px in width. To view from GitHub, download all files into a folder to your local storage and open from there in a browser to achieve viewing pleasure. Alternatively, you can view the file by adding http://htmlpreview.github.io/? (yes, with the question mark) before the full link of the index page (http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/medeaggd/uda-portfolio/blob/master/index.html in this instance).

##Gratitude
I'd like to give a shout out to Richard Schott for helping me troubleshoot and making sure to catch the things I might gloss over. I also received invaluable assistance from my Udacity mentor, Marcello. Sometimes it's the littlest things that help you get past a stumbling block.
