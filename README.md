##Megan Quinn's Udacity Portfolio
This is a personal portfolio designed to show off projects completed for the Udacity Front-End nanodegree course, along with work done for the Grow With Google challenge. This file and links therein are a glimpse of my developing skills as a front-end web dev (and my woeful neglect of digital art skills).
